## Code for Canada Challenge

<p>
Used https://github.com/zmcadie/tmc-interview-skeleton as inspiration and created an Angular / C# Web API instance
</p>

### INSTALLATION

1. Download this repo locally.
2. Go to the `CountryService\CountryService` folder
3. Run `dotnet run`
3. Go to the `country-webapp` folder
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `ng start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### SUGGESTION

<p>
I would also suggest to include unit testing. There will be added time to create the unit tests, but it will help the avoid having difficult conversations with the customer over small bugs and will show expected behaviour if it is going through a Peer Review process.
